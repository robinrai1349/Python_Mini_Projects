### Summary ###

Using Python and Web scraping to retrieve or "scrape" data from a website with dynamically refreshing counters displaying current world population, births today, deaths today, population growth, etc. This data is then collected and exported into a more compact and useful format for the user. In this project, I export the collected data as a spreadsheet.

## Data Source ##

Using **[Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)** website to fetch the data because the page is dynamic and the counters are updating live.
